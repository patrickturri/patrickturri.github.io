This past summer, I attended 'Olifis Er-Marche' summer school, a residential program with the aim of preparing 32 junior or senior high school students selected from Emilia Romagna and Marche regions of Italy for the Physics Olympics (National and International). The admission process is based on academic grades in mathematics and physics and on the results achieved in the Physics Olympics competition. We have done approximately 40 hours of study in total, with a different physics topic for each day. 

We visited the **National laboratories of Legnaro** where we got to see accelerators, experimental equipment and technological laboratories for nuclear physics and interdisciplinary physics.  

We attended a **conference about chaos theory and turbolence** held by Phd student Daniele Simeoni.
He presented the main models used in fluid dynamics, and explained how a Computational Physicist approaches his daily work.

I had the opportunity to meet talented and motivated students. We shared ideas, we worked and had fun together.
