From the 30th of June to the 2 of July I participated to the 
[Scuola di Orientamento Universitario 2020](https://www.santannapisa.it/it/event/scuola-di-orientamento-universitario-2020){:target="_blank"} event. It was a 3 day program in which university lessons, exercises and group activities took place, as well as moments of comparison and interaction with the students. Organised by the confederation of 3 schools: **Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna**, **Scuola Normale Superiore** and **Scuola Universitaria Superiore IUSS of Pavia**. 
It's entirely free and only the students that have completed the 12th grade can apply. The number of [student's selected](https://www.santannapisa.it/sites/default/files/elenco_degli_ammessi_e_assegnazione_ai_corsi.pdf){:target="_blank"} this year was about 300.
The course was held entirely online through the Cisco webex Events hosting platoform because of COVID-19 situation, but there's going to be a school visit in future for the students that have participated, so we can try the residential experience that all the 'Allievi Ordinari' of the school live every day during the University period. 
   
# The seminars I took part
Each day, you had to enter the room of one out of six webinars, and all of them were about very different topics, from philosophy to computer science or from politic science to neuroscience and so on. These are the ones I attend:

**The talk was about consciousness**, a topic I think is becoming more and more relevant these days with the improving of A.I. technologies. We discussed a philosophical thought experiment: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGYmiQkah4o" target="_blank">'Mary's Room'</a>. In a nutshell, it attempts to refute the theory that all knowledge is physical knowledge. The conversations was really intriguing and **made me ponder upon some profound questions I have never thought about**, such as: could it be that there are fundamental limits to what we can know about something we can't experience? And would this mean there are certain aspects of the universe that lie permanently beyond our comprehension?

# My experience
For a young student, facing the choice of a university path, requires an awareness that is certainly not easy to acquire and it is even more complex to orient oneself knwowing that there could be an an additional university study path such as that represented by the didactic offer of a School of Advanced Studies in Italy.
The S.O.U. gave me a broad perspective of the possible paths to take for my future. **I discovered new interests** and I had great conversations with the tutors-students** about the topics I am more curious, such as the activities and programs that each University offer to the 'Allievi Ordinari' or how much coding they do in a Computer Science major, what tips could they offer to pass the admission test and how hard it is etc...

I think this was definitely the part that I enjoyed the most because the tutor-students made us very comfortable trying to answer and clarify all the doubts and questions that we had.
