From the 30th of June to the 2 of July I participated to the [Scuola di Orientamento Universitario 2020](https://www.santannapisa.it/it/event/scuola-di-orientamento-universitario-2020) event. It was a 3 day program in which university lessons, exercises and group activities took place, as well as moments of comparison and interaction with the students. Organised by the confederation of 3 schools: **Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna**, **Scuola Normale Superiore** and **Scuola Universitaria Superiore IUSS of Pavia**. 
It's entirely free and only the students that have completed the 12th grade can apply. The number of [student's selected](https://www.santannapisa.it/sites/default/files/elenco_degli_ammessi_e_assegnazione_ai_corsi.pdf) this year was about 300.
The course was held entirely online through the Cisco webex Events hosting platoform because of COVID-19 situation, but there's going to be a school visit in future for the students that have participated, so we can try the residential experience that all the 'Allievi Ordinari' of the school live every day during the University period.

# My experience
For a young student, facing the choice of a university path, requires an awareness that is certainly not easy to acquire and it is even more complex to orient oneself knwowing that there could be an an additional university study path such as that represented by the didactic offer of a School of Advanced Studies in Italy.
The S.O.U. gave me a broad perspective of the possible paths to take for my future. I discovered **new interests** and I had **great conversations** with the tutors-students about the topics I am more curious, such as the activities and programs that each University offer to the 'Allievi Ordinari' or how much coding they do in a Computer Science major, what tips could they offer to pass the admission test and how hard it is etc...

I think this was definitely the part that I enjoyed the most because the tutor-students made us very comfortable trying to answer and clarify all the doubts and questions that we had.
