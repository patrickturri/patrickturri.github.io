I had the incredible opportunity to represent ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ at this internetational event with my [project](https://projectboard.world/isef/finalist-booth/robo081---automated-software-to-compare-soa-vio-algorithms) about machine perception, i.e. how robots navigate and map the world. The event was supposed to take place in California but unfortunately it became a virtual event due to COVID-19. Anyway, this was a life-changing experience where I had the opportunity to exchange ideas with other passionate students and get inspired by the cutting-edge research projects of the speakers. Those are the [highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUi9g0-hmI&t=220s) of the event.
Many thanks to [FAST](https://fast.mi.it/i-giovani-e-le-scienze/) to stimulate the spirit of innovation and collaboration among students.
