Fun and stimulating course in data structures and advanced algorithms in C++ for high school students. 
The course is organized by alumni of the Liceo Scientifico in Imola (the high school with the most medals at the Italian Olympiads in Informatics) , an italian city near Bologna, 100km away from my hometown. Due to COVID-19 the course became online and I've been able to partecipate remotely.
The goal of the project is to build a community of young coders that can learn together computer science topics (the fun way) and help each other.
